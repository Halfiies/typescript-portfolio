  text: `Hi! Im Morris. 
    Due to my existing passion for technology, I have made the jump to pursue a career in a field that I feel i will continue to be interested in as it further develops with future technological advancements. I have an innate want to help others with any obstacles and conflicts that may occur. This includes troubleshooting and assisting clients, but also supporting and encouraging current and future peer colleagues. I am currently developing my skill set in many areas, this includes further expanding my catalogue of software proficiency. This includes the use of stack overflow and coding using vscode, javascript, html and scss. The main goal for me is to enjoy what I do whilst also facing varying work dynamics with new challenges for me with each day.`,
