  text: `Hi! Im Morris. 
  After years of working in retail and not finding my place, I decided to change careers dramatically, and learned to code. I enrolled in the _nology web development course, and in the last 12 weeks I have learned to write HTML, CSS, Javascript and Java. I have learned the react framework, and how to work with mySQL databases. I have completed multiple projects, including a large client project, and a full website from the database in SQL, the API in java, and the front end in react and typescript. 
  I Have also learned how to use github for version control, and trello for agile workflows`,
