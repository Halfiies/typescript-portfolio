    text: "This was a project to help reinforce my knowledge of basic javascript functions. Writing the calculator code was more difficult that i expected, and if i had to do this again i would take a different approcah, using regex look forward and behind to enable more complicated operations. It was quite frustrating not using eval, but it did help me learn to write better code.",

    text: "This project was created with react and firebase by the Jersey intake of the _nology software developer course. The project demonstrated possible design changes for Lujams dashboard redesign. The project is built in React and uses Firebase for hosting and authorization. The project ran for four weeks, with each week taking the form of a sprint with a new product owner assigned. Each sprint ended with a demo to the clients. The feedback informed the next sprint's tickets. The product owner planned the tickets and wrote the acceptance criteria for completion. Trello was used to manage workflow. A git branching strategy was used to work on multiple features. Once a pull request was completed the feature would be added to the codebase.",
